            <p id="home_p1">Though there are a large number of differing cosmetics used for a variety of different purposes, all
                cosmetics are typically intended to be applied externally. These products can be applied to the face (on
                the skin, lips, eyebrows and eyes), to the body (on the skin, in particular the hands and nails), and to
                the hair. These products may be intended for use as skincare, personal care or to alter the appearance,
                with the subset of cosmetics known as makeup primarily referring to products containing colour pigments
                intended for the purpose of altering the wearer's appearance; some manufacturers will distinguish only
                between "decorative" cosmetics intended to alter the appearance and "care" cosmetics designed for
                skincare and personal care.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="home_p1">Most cosmetics are also distinguished by the area of the body intended for application, with cosmetics
                designed to be used on the face and eye area usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the
                fingertips.</p>

            <p id="home_p2">Cosmetics are widely used and accepted in many different cultures. The popularity of cosmetics can be
                attributed to the creative self-expression and self-identity aspect. Makeup and cosmetics can be used to
                subtly enhance natural features or create a brand new, out-of-this-world look. The cosmetic and makeup
                industry is worth billions of dollars and continues to increase due to the growing popularity and
                acceptance of makeup and cosmetics.</p>

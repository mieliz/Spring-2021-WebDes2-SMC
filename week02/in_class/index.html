            <p id="home_p1">Cosmetics are a category of health and beauty products that are used to care for the face and body, or
                used to accentuate or change a person's appearance. Though cosmetics are commonly thought of as only
                makeup used to alter a person's appearance, cosmetics can also refer to a number of products used to
                care for the skin and the body, as well as those used to add fragrance to it. There are a large number
                of cosmetics available under these various categories, each designed for different purposes and
                featuring different characteristics.</p>

            <p id="home_p2">Cosmetics are widely used and accepted in many different cultures. The popularity of cosmetics can be
                attributed to the creative self-expression and self-identity aspect. Makeup and cosmetics can be used to
                subtly enhance natural features or create a brand new, out-of-this-world look. The cosmetic and makeup
                industry is worth billions of dollars and continues to increase due to the growing popularity and
                acceptance of makeup and cosmetics.</p>

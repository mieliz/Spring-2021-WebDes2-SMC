            <p id="home_p1">Cosmetics have been in use for thousands of years. The absence of regulation of the manufacture and use
                of cosmetics, as well as the absence of scientific knowledge regarding the effects of various compounds
                on the human body for much of this time period, led historically to a number of negative adverse effects
                upon those who used cosmetics, including deformities, blindness and in some cases death. Examples of the
                prevalent usage of harmful cosmetics include the use of ceruse (white lead) throughout a number of
                different cultures, such as during the Renaissance in the West, and blindness caused by the mascara Lash
                Lure during the early 20th century.</p>

            <p id="home_p1">One of the earliest cultures to use cosmetics was ancient Egypt, where both Egyptian men and women used
                makeup to enhance their appearance. The use of black kohl eyeliner and eyeshadows in dark colours such
                as blue, red, and black was common, and was commonly recorded and represented in Egyptian art, as well
                as being seen in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Ancient Egyptians also extracted red dye from fucus-algin, 0.01%
                iodine, and some bromine mannite,[vague] but this dye resulted in serious illness. Lipsticks with
                shimmering effects were initially made using a pearlescent substance found in fish scales, which are
                still used extensively today. Despite the hazardous nature of some Egyptian cosmetics, ancient
                Egyptian makeup was also thought to have antibacterial properties that helped prevent infections.</p>
